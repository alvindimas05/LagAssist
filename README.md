# LagAssist

This is the fork of [LagAssist](https://git.entryrise.com/stefatorus/LagAssist) plugin.
My goal here is to support for newer version of Spigot or Paper Minecraft.
You can find the original Spigot page [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lagassist-%E2%9A%A1-advanced-performance-solution-%E2%9A%A1-1-8-1-19-x-compatible.56399/
).

LagAssist is a plugin that provides tools to be used to analyse, prevent and resolve lag.

## Recommended Plugins

I've been using these plugins for my Minecraft Server and they are highly recommended for optimization.

- <b>[Chunky](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky)</b> this plugin pre-generates chunks efficiently to reduce lags.
- <b>[ChunkSpawnerLimiter](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunkspawnerlimiter)</b> this plugin reduces mobs spawn which useful 
to prevent big mob farms if you don't want to use StackMob for some reason.
